# Task 3.5: Real-Time First Architecture Implementation

## Overview
Implement a real-time first event system using WebSockets (Socket.IO) with IndexedDB outbox as a reliability safety net. This approach prioritizes immediate updates for family sharing while maintaining bulletproof offline capabilities.

## Core Principle: Real-Time Everything + Outbox as Safety Net

### Architecture Philosophy
- **Primary**: All events attempt real-time WebSocket broadcast first
- **Fallback**: IndexedDB outbox only used when real-time fails
- **Recovery**: Automatic sync of queued events when connection restored
- **Reliability**: Zero data loss guaranteed through outbox safety net

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Real-Time First Flow
```typescript
// Simple Strategy: Try real-time first, outbox as backup
class EventService {
  async addEvent(event: MatchEvent) {
    try {
      // 1. ALWAYS try real-time first
      if (socket.connected) {
        await socket.emit('match_event', event);
        console.log('✅ Event sent real-time');
        return; // Success! We're done.
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.log('❌ Real-time failed, using outbox');
    }
    
    // 2. ONLY use outbox if real-time fails
    await db.addToOutbox('events', event.id, 'INSERT', event);
  }
}
```

### 2. WebSocket Room Strategy
```typescript
// Backend: Simple broadcasting to match participants
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  socket.on('join_match', (matchId) => {
    socket.join(`match_${matchId}`);
  });
  
  socket.on('match_event', (event) => {
    // Broadcast to all clients watching this match
    io.to(`match_${event.matchId}`).emit('live_event', event);
    
    // Also broadcast to team-specific rooms for family filtering
    io.to(`team_${event.teamId}`).emit('team_event', event);
  });
});
```

### 3. Outbox as Safety Net
```typescript
// Frontend: Periodic sync when connection available
setInterval(async () => {
  if (socket.connected && !syncing) {
    const unsyncedEvents = await db.getUnsyncedEvents();
    for (const event of unsyncedEvents) {
      try {
        await socket.emit('match_event', event.data);
        await db.markEventSynced(event.id);
      } catch {
        // Will retry next interval
      }
    }
  }
}, 5000); // Check every 5 seconds
```

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes Required

#### 1. Add Socket.IO Client Dependencies
```bash
npm install socket.io-client @types/socket.io-client
```

#### 2. Real-Time Event Service
```typescript
// frontend/src/services/realTimeEventService.ts
export class RealTimeEventService {
  private socket: Socket;
  
  constructor() {
    this.socket = io('http://localhost:3001');
    this.setupEventHandlers();
  }
  
  async publishEvent(event: MatchEvent): Promise<boolean> {
    // Always try real-time first
    const realTimeSuccess = await this.tryRealTime(event);
    
    if (!realTimeSuccess) {
      // Only use outbox as fallback
      await this.addToOutbox(event);
      this.scheduleRetry();
      return false;
    }
    
    return true;
  }
  
  private async tryRealTime(event: MatchEvent): Promise<boolean> {
    if (!this.socket.connected) return false;
    
    try {
      await this.socket.emit('match_event', event);
      return true;
    } catch {
      return false;
    }
  }
  
  private setupEventHandlers() {
    this.socket.on('live_event', (event) => {
      // Update local state immediately
      this.updateMatchContext(event);
    });
    
    this.socket.on('connect', () => {
      console.log('🔗 Real-time connection established');
      this.syncOutbox(); // Sync any queued events
    });
    
    this.socket.on('disconnect', () => {
      console.log('📡 Real-time connection lost - using outbox mode');
    });
  }
}
```

#### 3. Enhanced Match Context Integration
```typescript
// frontend/src/contexts/MatchContext.tsx
const addEvent = useCallback(async (eventData: Omit<MatchEvent, 'id' | 'created'>) => {
  const event = {
    ...eventData,
    id: generateEventId(),
    created: Date.now()
  };
  
  // Try real-time first
  const realTimeSuccess = await realTimeService.publishEvent(event);
  
  if (realTimeSuccess) {
    // Update local state immediately for instant UI feedback
    setEvents(prev => [...prev, event]);
  } else {
    // Event queued in outbox, update UI with "pending" indicator
    setEvents(prev => [...prev, { ...event, status: 'pending' }]);
  }
}, []);
```

### Backend Changes Required

#### 1. Socket.IO Integration with Express
```typescript
// backend/src/app.ts
import { Server } from 'socket.io';
import { createServer } from 'http';

const server = createServer(app);
const io = new Server(server, {
  cors: {
    origin: process.env.FRONTEND_URL || "http://localhost:5173",
    methods: ["GET", "POST"]
  }
});

// Socket.IO event handling
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  console.log('Client connected:', socket.id);
  
  socket.on('join_match', (matchId: string) => {
    socket.join(`match_${matchId}`);
    console.log(`Client ${socket.id} joined match ${matchId}`);
  });
  
  socket.on('match_event', async (event) => {
    try {
      // Save to database
      const savedEvent = await eventService.createEvent(event);
      
      // Broadcast to all clients watching this match
      io.to(`match_${event.matchId}`).emit('live_event', savedEvent);
      
      // Also broadcast to team-specific rooms
      io.to(`team_${event.teamId}`).emit('team_event', savedEvent);
      
    } catch (error) {
      socket.emit('event_error', { event, error: error.message });
    }
  });
  
  socket.on('disconnect', () => {
    console.log('Client disconnected:', socket.id);
  });
});
```

#### 2. Enhanced Event Routes
```typescript
// backend/src/routes/v1/events.ts
// Keep existing REST API for batch operations and fallback
// Add real-time broadcasting to existing endpoints

router.post('/', validateRequest(eventCreateSchema), asyncHandler(async (req, res) => {
  const event = await eventService.createEvent(req.body);
  
  // Immediately broadcast to all connected clients
  io.to(`match_${event.matchId}`).emit('live_event', event);
  
  res.status(201).json(event);
}));
```
