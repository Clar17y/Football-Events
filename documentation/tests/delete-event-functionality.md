# Delete Event Functionality - Test Documentation

## Issue Addressed
- User disabled browser alerts in Chrome ("not allow localhost to alert me again")
- Trash icon for deleting events stopped working because `window.confirm()` was blocked

## Solution Implemented
- Replaced `window.confirm()` with custom Toast-based confirmation dialog
- Uses existing ToastContext with action buttons
- Shows confirmation message with "Delete" and "Dismiss" buttons
- Added toast stacking prevention to ensure clean UI

## Test Plan

### Prerequisites
1. Start the application: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the match console
3. Create several test events for testing

### Test Scenarios

#### 1. Basic Delete Functionality
**Steps:**
1. Click on any event button (Goal, Foul, etc.)
2. Select a team and add a player
3. Save the event to create test data
4. Repeat to create multiple events
5. Click the trash icon next to any event in the event log

**Expected Results:**
- Toast notification appears at the top with message: "Delete [EventType] by [PlayerName] ([TeamName])?"
- Two buttons are visible: "Delete" (red) and "Dismiss"
- Event details are clearly displayed in the confirmation message

**Verification:**
- Click "Delete" button
- Event should be removed from the list
- Success toast should appear: "Event deleted successfully"

#### 2. Cancel Delete Operation
**Steps:**
1. Click trash icon on any event
2. Click "Dismiss" instead of "Delete"

**Expected Results:**
- Event remains in the list unchanged
- Confirmation toast disappears
- No success or error messages appear

#### 3. Toast Stacking Prevention
**Steps:**
1. Delete an event successfully (success toast appears)
2. While the success toast is still visible, click trash icon on another event

**Expected Results:**
- Success toast is immediately cleared
- Only the new confirmation toast is visible
- No overlapping or stacked toasts
- Clean, uncluttered UI

#### 4. Multiple Rapid Deletions
**Steps:**
1. Click trash icon on first event
2. Immediately click trash icon on second event (before confirming first)

**Expected Results:**
- First confirmation toast is cleared
- Second confirmation toast appears cleanly
- Only one confirmation dialog visible at a time

#### 5. Error Handling
**Steps:**
1. Simulate network failure (disconnect internet)
2. Try to delete an event

**Expected Results:**
- Appropriate error message appears
- User is informed of the failure
- Event remains in the list

### Browser Independence Testing

#### Chrome with Alerts Disabled
**Steps:**
1. In Chrome, go to Settings > Privacy and Security > Site Settings
2. Find localhost and disable notifications/alerts
3. Test delete functionality

**Expected Results:**
- Delete functionality works normally
- No browser alert dialogs appear
- Custom toast confirmations work properly

#### Cross-Browser Testing
**Browsers to test:**
- Chrome (with and without alerts disabled)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

**Expected Results:**
- Consistent behavior across all browsers
- No dependency on browser alert settings

### Performance Testing

#### Large Event Lists
**Steps:**
1. Create 20+ events in the match console
2. Test delete functionality on various events

**Expected Results:**
- Delete operations remain fast and responsive
- UI updates smoothly
- No performance degradation

## Code Changes Summary

### Files Modified
- `src/pages/MatchConsole.tsx`
  - Modified `handleDeleteEvent()` to use toast confirmation
  - Added `confirmDeleteEvent()` for actual deletion logic
  - Added `clearAllToasts()` to prevent stacking
  - Uses existing ToastContext infrastructure

### Key Improvements
1. **Browser Independence**: No reliance on `window.confirm()`
2. **Better UX**: Detailed confirmation messages with event context
3. **Clean UI**: Toast stacking prevention ensures single dialog visibility
4. **Consistent Design**: Uses existing toast system and styling
5. **Error Handling**: Maintains all existing error handling and success feedback
