# Calendar Component Research and Analysis

## Overview
This document evaluates calendar component options for the Matches page, focusing on the requirement for a 14+ day view with team color indicators and click-to-create functionality.

## Requirements Analysis
Based on the design document, we need:
1. **14+ day view** - Show current date + next 14 days minimum (spans months)
2. **Team color indicators** - Visual match indicators using home/away team colors
3. **Click interactions** - Empty dates open CreateMatchModal, match indicators navigate to lists
4. **Responsive design** - Mobile-first with Ionic/grassroots design system integration
5. **Accessibility** - WCAG compliance and screen reader support

## Library Evaluation

### 1. React Calendar (v6.0.0)
**Pros:**
- ✅ Lightweight (443KB unpacked)
- ✅ Simple API and good customization options
- ✅ Active maintenance (latest release May 2025)
- ✅ Good TypeScript support
- ✅ Supports custom tile content for match indicators
- ✅ Click handlers for individual dates
- ✅ CSS customizable for grassroots theme integration

**Cons:**
- ❌ **Major limitation**: Designed for month view, not 14+ day view
- ❌ No built-in support for custom date ranges spanning months
- ❌ Would require significant customization to achieve 14+ day layout
- ❌ Month-centric navigation doesn't fit our use case

**Feasibility for 14+ day view:** ⚠️ **Difficult** - Would need extensive customization

### 2. React Big Calendar (v1.19.4)
**Pros:**
- ✅ Multiple view types (month, week, day, agenda)
- ✅ Event rendering with custom components
- ✅ Good customization and theming options
- ✅ Active maintenance (latest release June 2025)
- ✅ Supports custom event styling (perfect for team colors)
- ✅ Click handlers for events and empty slots

**Cons:**
- ❌ **Major limitation**: No built-in 14+ day view
- ❌ Large bundle size (2.6MB unpacked)
- ❌ Complex API with many dependencies (moment, luxon, dayjs, etc.)
- ❌ Designed for full calendar applications, not simple date ranges
- ❌ Would require creating custom view type for 14+ days

**Feasibility for 14+ day view:** ⚠️ **Very Difficult** - No support for custom date ranges

### 3. React DatePicker (v8.4.0)
**Pros:**
- ✅ Lightweight and focused
- ✅ Good TypeScript support
- ✅ Active maintenance (latest release May 2025)
- ✅ Customizable day rendering
- ✅ Uses date-fns (modern date library)

**Cons:**
- ❌ **Major limitation**: Primarily designed for date selection, not calendar display
- ❌ Focus is on input/picker functionality, not calendar views
- ❌ No built-in support for event/match indicators
- ❌ Not suitable for our calendar display requirements

**Feasibility for 14+ day view:** ❌ **Not Suitable** - Wrong use case

### 4. MUI X Date Pickers (v8.10.0) - Already Installed
**Pros:**
- ✅ Already installed and integrated
- ✅ Excellent TypeScript support
- ✅ Material Design integration
- ✅ Uses dayjs (already in project)
- ✅ StaticDatePicker component for calendar display
- ✅ Custom day rendering support
- ✅ Good accessibility features

**Cons:**
- ❌ **Major limitation**: Month-view focused, no 14+ day view
- ❌ Material Design styling may conflict with grassroots theme
- ❌ Complex API for simple calendar needs
- ❌ Would require significant customization for our layout

**Feasibility for 14+ day view:** ⚠️ **Difficult** - Month-centric design

## Custom Implementation Analysis

### Custom Calendar Component
**Pros:**
- ✅ **Perfect fit** for 14+ day requirement
- ✅ Complete control over styling and theming
- ✅ Optimized for our specific use case
- ✅ No external dependencies beyond dayjs (already installed)
- ✅ Can integrate perfectly with Ionic components
- ✅ Smaller bundle size
- ✅ Easy to implement team color indicators
- ✅ Simple click handling for our specific needs

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ More development time required
- ⚠️ Need to handle date calculations manually
- ⚠️ Accessibility features need to be implemented
- ⚠️ Testing requirements for date edge cases

**Implementation Complexity:** 🟢 **Moderate** - Straightforward with dayjs

## Technical Decision

### Recommendation: Custom Implementation

**Rationale:**
1. **Perfect Requirements Match**: None of the third-party libraries support our specific 14+ day view requirement without major customization
2. **Existing Dependencies**: We already have dayjs for date manipulation
3. **Design System Integration**: Custom implementation allows perfect integration with grassroots design system and Ionic components
4. **Bundle Size**: Smaller footprint than adding large calendar libraries
5. **Maintenance**: Simpler to maintain and modify for future requirements

### Implementation Plan

#### Core Structure
```typescript
interface CalendarProps {
  startDate: Date;
  matches: Match[];
  onDateClick: (date: Date) => void;
  onMatchClick: (matchId: string) => void;
}

interface CalendarCell {
  date: Date;
  isToday: boolean;
  matches: Match[];
  isCurrentMonth: boolean;
}
```

#### Key Features
1. **Date Range Calculation**: Use dayjs to calculate 14+ day range from current date
2. **Grid Layout**: CSS Grid with 7 columns for days of week
3. **Match Indicators**: Small colored dots using team colors
4. **Click Handling**: Distinguish between empty date clicks and match indicator clicks
5. **Responsive Design**: Ionic breakpoints and mobile-first approach

#### Dependencies Required
- ✅ dayjs (already installed)
- ✅ Ionic React components (already installed)
- ✅ No additional calendar libraries needed

#### Estimated Development Time
- **Calendar Grid Component**: 4-6 hours
- **Date Utilities**: 2-3 hours
- **Match Indicators**: 2-3 hours
- **Click Handling**: 1-2 hours
- **Styling & Responsive**: 3-4 hours
- **Testing**: 2-3 hours
- **Total**: 14-21 hours

## Alternative Approach (If Custom Proves Complex)

If custom implementation faces unexpected challenges, **React Calendar** would be the fallback option with these modifications:
1. Override the month view to show only 14+ days
2. Hide month navigation
3. Custom CSS to create horizontal layout
4. Estimated additional complexity: +8-12 hours

## Conclusion

**Custom implementation is the recommended approach** because:
- It perfectly matches our unique 14+ day view requirement
- Integrates seamlessly with existing tech stack
- Provides complete control over styling and behavior
- Results in cleaner, more maintainable code
- Avoids the complexity of forcing third-party libraries into unsupported use cases

The development effort is justified by the perfect fit for requirements and long-term maintainability benefits.
