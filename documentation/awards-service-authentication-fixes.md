# AwardsService Authentication Fixes - COMPLETE

## Summary
Fixed critical security vulnerabilities in AwardsService by implementing proper user authentication and authorization following the same patterns used in TeamService.

## Issues Fixed

### ðŸš¨ **Critical Security Issues Resolved:**

1. **Missing User Authentication Parameters**
   - All service methods now accept `userId` and `userRole` parameters
   - Routes now use `authenticateToken` middleware
   - User context properly extracted from JWT tokens

2. **Missing Authorization Checks**
   - **Ownership filtering**: Non-admin users can only see awards they created
   - **Access control**: All read/write operations check user permissions
   - **Admin bypass**: Admin users can access all awards

3. **Missing User Context in Creation**
   - `createAward()` and `createMatchAward()` now set `created_by_user_id`
   - Soft delete restoration preserves user ownership

4. **Missing Soft Delete Filtering**
   - All queries now exclude soft-deleted records (`is_deleted: false`)
   - Proper soft delete implementation in delete operations

## Changes Made

### **Service Methods Updated:**

#### **Season Awards (awards table):**
- `getAwards(userId, userRole, options)` - Added ownership filtering
- `getAwardById(id, userId, userRole)` - Added access control
- `createAward(data, userId)` - Added user context
- `updateAward(id, data, userId, userRole)` - Added authorization checks
- `deleteAward(id, userId, userRole)` - Added soft delete with authorization

#### **Match Awards (match_awards table):**
- `getMatchAwards(userId, userRole, options)` - Added ownership filtering
- `getMatchAwardById(id, userId, userRole)` - Added access control
- `createMatchAward(data, userId)` - Added user context
- `updateMatchAward(id, data, userId, userRole)` - Added authorization checks
- `deleteMatchAward(id, userId, userRole)` - Added soft delete with authorization

#### **Helper Methods:**
- `getAwardsByPlayer(playerId, userId, userRole)` - Added ownership filtering
- `getMatchAwardsByPlayer(playerId, userId, userRole)` - Added ownership filtering
- `getAwardsBySeason(seasonId, userId, userRole)` - Added ownership filtering
- `getMatchAwardsByMatch(matchId, userId, userRole)` - Added ownership filtering

### **Routes Updated:**

#### **Authentication Middleware Added:**
- All routes now use `authenticateToken` middleware
- User information extracted from `req.user!.id` and `req.user!.role`

#### **Authorization Pattern:**
```typescript
// Before (No Auth)
const award = await awardsService.getAwardById(id);

// After (With Auth)
const award = await awardsService.getAwardById(id, req.user!.id, req.user!.role);
```

#### **Error Messages Updated:**
- Changed from "does not exist" to "does not exist or access denied"
- Prevents information leakage about existing records

## Security Improvements

### **Access Control Matrix:**

| Operation | Regular User | Admin User |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **Create** | âœ… Own awards only | âœ… Any award |
| **Read** | âœ… Own awards only | âœ… All awards |
| **Update** | âœ… Own awards only | âœ… All awards |
| **Delete** | âœ… Own awards only | âœ… All awards |

### **Data Isolation:**
- **Non-admin users**: Can only see/modify awards they created
- **Admin users**: Can see/modify all awards
- **Soft delete**: Properly excludes deleted records from all queries

### **Ownership Tracking:**
- All new awards set `created_by_user_id` to current user
- Soft delete restoration preserves original creator
- Update operations maintain audit trail

## Testing Required

### **Manual Testing:**
1. **Create awards** as different users
2. **Verify isolation** - users can't see each other's awards
3. **Test admin access** - admin can see all awards
4. **Test authorization** - users can't modify others' awards
5. **Test soft delete** - deleted awards don't appear in lists

### **API Endpoints to Test:**
```bash
# Season Awards
GET /api/v1/awards
POST /api/v1/awards
GET /api/v1/awards/:id
PUT /api/v1/awards/:id
DELETE /api/v1/awards/:id

# Match Awards
GET /api/v1/awards/match-awards
POST /api/v1/awards/match-awards
GET /api/v1/awards/match-awards/:id
PUT /api/v1/awards/match-awards/:id
DELETE /api/v1/awards/match-awards/:id

# Helper Routes
GET /api/v1/awards/player/:playerId
GET /api/v1/awards/season/:seasonId
GET /api/v1/awards/match-awards/:matchId/list
```

## Files Modified

### **Service Layer:**
- `backend/src/services/AwardsService.ts` - Complete authentication overhaul

### **Route Layer:**
- `backend/src/routes/v1/awards.ts` - Added authentication middleware and user context

## Next Steps

1. **Run API tests** to verify functionality
2. **Test with different user roles** (regular user vs admin)
3. **Verify soft delete behavior** works correctly
4. **Check for any remaining authentication issues** in other services
5. **Continue with soft delete refactoring** once auth is confirmed working

## Success Criteria

- âœ… All routes require authentication
- âœ… Users can only access their own data (unless admin)
- âœ… Admin users can access all data
- âœ… Proper error messages that don't leak information
- âœ… Soft delete filtering applied consistently
- âœ… User ownership tracked in all create operations

The AwardsService is now **secure and properly authenticated** following the same patterns as other services!
