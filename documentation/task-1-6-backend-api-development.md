# Task 1.6: Backend API Development (Node.js/TypeScript) ❌

**Status:** Not Started  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Estimated Time:** 8-10 hours  
**Actual Time:** -  
**Completion Date:** -

## Description

Develop a Node.js/TypeScript backend API to replace the current IndexedDB-only storage with a proper PostgreSQL database and real-time capabilities. This backend will enable family sharing, cloud storage, and advanced analytics while maintaining offline capabilities for mobile use.

## Current Issues

- **No Persistent Storage**: Data only exists in browser IndexedDB
- **No Real-time Sharing**: Cannot share live match updates with family
- **No Cloud Access**: Data trapped on single device
- **No Multi-device Sync**: Cannot access data across devices
- **Limited Analytics**: No server-side data processing capabilities
- **No Backup/Recovery**: Risk of data loss

## Technical Stack Decisions

### Core Technologies
- **Runtime**: Node.js (LTS version)
- **Language**: TypeScript for type safety
- **Framework**: Express.js for HTTP API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (existing schema)
- **ORM**: Prisma for type-safe database access
- **Real-time**: Socket.io for WebSocket connections
- **Validation**: Zod (consistent with frontend)
- **Testing**: Jest for unit and integration tests

### Architecture Patterns
- **RESTful API**: Standard HTTP endpoints for CRUD operations
- **WebSocket Events**: Real-time updates for live match sharing
- **Middleware Pattern**: Authentication, validation, error handling
- **Service Layer**: Business logic separation from routes
- **Repository Pattern**: Database access abstraction

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (2-3 hours)
- Project structure and TypeScript configuration
- Express.js application setup with middleware
- Prisma ORM configuration and database connection
- Basic error handling and logging
- Health check and status endpoints

### Phase 2: Core Match API (3-4 hours)
- Match CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
- Event logging endpoints (goals, cards, substitutions)
- Real-time event broadcasting via WebSocket
- Basic authentication for match access
- Data validation and error responses

### Phase 3: Real-time Sharing (2-3 hours)
- Socket.io integration for live updates
- Match room management for family sharing
- Event broadcasting to connected clients
- Connection handling and reconnection logic
- Mobile-optimized WebSocket configuration

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing (1-2 hours)
- Frontend integration with new API endpoints
- Offline/online synchronization strategy
- Performance optimization and caching
- Comprehensive testing suite
- Documentation and deployment preparation

## Database Integration

### PostgreSQL Connection
- Use existing schema.sql as foundation
- Prisma schema generation from existing database
- Connection pooling for performance
- Environment-based configuration (dev/prod)
- Migration strategy for schema updates

### Data Migration Strategy
- Gradual migration from IndexedDB to PostgreSQL
- Dual-write pattern during transition
- Data export/import utilities
- Backup and recovery procedures
- Performance monitoring and optimization

## API Design Principles

### RESTful Endpoints
- Consistent URL patterns and HTTP methods
- Proper status codes and error responses
- JSON request/response format
- Pagination for large datasets
- Filtering and sorting capabilities

### Real-time Events
- WebSocket connection management
- Event-driven architecture for live updates
- Room-based broadcasting for match sharing
- Efficient data serialization
- Connection state management

### Security Considerations
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- CORS configuration for frontend access
- Environment variable management
- Secure WebSocket connections

## Development Environment

### Local Setup
- Docker Compose for PostgreSQL database
- Hot reload for development
- Environment variable management
- Logging and debugging configuration
- Database seeding for development data

### Production Considerations
- Cloud hosting platform selection
- Environment configuration management
- Database backup and recovery
- Monitoring and alerting
- Performance optimization

## Mobile Optimization

### Offline Capabilities
- Service worker integration for API caching
- Queue-based synchronization when online
- Conflict resolution for concurrent edits
- Progressive enhancement approach
- Bandwidth-conscious data transfer

### Real-time Performance
- Efficient WebSocket message format
- Connection management for mobile networks
- Automatic reconnection handling
- Battery-conscious update frequency
- Data compression for mobile networks

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Service layer business logic
- Database repository functions
- Utility functions and helpers
- Validation schema testing
- Error handling scenarios

### Integration Tests
- API endpoint functionality
- Database operations
- WebSocket event handling
- Authentication flows
- Error response validation

### End-to-End Tests
- Complete match workflow
- Real-time sharing scenarios
- Mobile offline/online transitions
- Multi-user concurrent access
- Performance under load

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Match data persists in PostgreSQL database
- [ ] Real-time updates work across multiple devices
- [ ] API endpoints handle all current IndexedDB operations
- [ ] WebSocket connections stable on mobile networks
- [ ] Offline/online synchronization works reliably

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] API response times under 200ms for local operations
- [ ] WebSocket events delivered within 100ms
- [ ] Database queries optimized for mobile data usage
- [ ] Concurrent user support (10+ family members)
- [ ] Graceful degradation when offline

### Security Requirements
- [ ] Input validation prevents malicious data
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents abuse
- [ ] Secure WebSocket connections
- [ ] Environment variables protect sensitive data
- [ ] CORS properly configured for frontend access

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced Features
- Multi-tenant support for different teams
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- AI-powered match insights
- Third-party integrations
- Mobile app development support

### Scalability Considerations
- Horizontal scaling capabilities
- Caching layer implementation
- CDN integration for static assets
- Database sharding strategies
- Microservices architecture evolution

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites
- Repository restructure completion
- PostgreSQL database access
- Node.js development environment
- Frontend API integration points identified

### Blocking Tasks
- None (can begin immediately after restructure)

### Related Tasks
- Task 3.4: Mobile Match Console (will consume this API)
- Task 5.1: Team Management (will extend this API)
- Real-time sharing architecture implementation

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Database Migration**: Gradual transition with fallback to IndexedDB
- **Real-time Complexity**: Start with simple WebSocket implementation
- **Mobile Performance**: Optimize for 3G networks and battery life
- **Learning Curve**: Focus on essential features first

### Operational Risks
- **Deployment Complexity**: Use simple cloud platforms initially
- **Data Loss**: Implement comprehensive backup strategies
- **Downtime**: Maintain IndexedDB as backup during transition
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Regular dependency updates and security audits

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Backend API serves all match console functionality
- [ ] Real-time updates work reliably on iPhone
- [ ] Family members can view live match updates
- [ ] Data persists across device restarts and network issues
- [ ] Performance suitable for pitch-side mobile use
