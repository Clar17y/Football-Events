## üîÑ **Currently In Progress**

### Players Management Page Implementation
**Status**: STARTING üîÑ
- **Design Approach**: Player-centric (not team-centric) following "track individual player progress"
- **Theme**: Indigo color scheme (consistent with homepage)
- **Layout**: Unassigned/Assigned player sections
- **Features**: Search, filtering, team assignment, age calculation
- **Integration**: Links from Teams page with filter applied

**Implementation Plan**: [players-page-implementation-plan.md](players-page-implementation-plan.md)

## üìã **Next Steps (Immediate)**

### Phase 1: Core Players Page (Next 1-2 sessions)
1. **Create PlayersPage.tsx** with indigo theme and basic layout
2. **Implement player cards** with name, position, age, team assignment status
3. **Add Unassigned/Assigned sections** with proper data organization
4. **Integrate search functionality** using existing playersApi
5. **Add theme support** for indigo players theme

### Phase 2: Player Management (Following sessions)
1. **Create CreatePlayerModal.tsx** following established modal patterns
2. **Implement player CRUD operations** with validation
3. **Add PlayerContextMenu.tsx** with ellipses menu (Edit, Team Assignment, Stats, Delete)
4. **Teams page integration** - filter link to players page
5. **Enhanced filtering** - position, team, assignment status

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Decisions Made**

### Design Philosophy
- **Player-Centric Approach**: Focus on individual player management, not team rosters
- **Consistency**: Follow exact patterns from Teams/Seasons pages
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start simple, add advanced features incrementally
- **UK Grassroots Ready**: Foundation for age group calculations (future enhancement)

### Technical Approach
- **Two-Layer CSS**: CSS modules for structure, custom properties for theming
- **Theme Integration**: Indigo theme tokens following established pattern
- **API Integration**: Use existing playersApi with enhanced team relationship display
- **Component Reuse**: Leverage FormSection.module.css and established modal patterns

### User Experience
- **Unassigned/Assigned Sections**: Clear organization for multi-team scenarios
- **Smart Team Display**: Show team names for 1-2 teams, count for 3+ teams
- **Ellipses Menu**: Advanced actions without cluttering the card
- **Search & Filter**: Comprehensive filtering options for large player lists
