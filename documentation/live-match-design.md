# Live Match â€“ Mobile UX, Flows, and Data

This document captures the agreed UX, flows, offline behavior, and component breakdown for the Live Match feature.

## Key Decisions

- Sentiment range: -3 .. +3 (default 0).
- `player_id` may be null for opponent events (no dummy needed).
- Notes: editable before and after completion.
- Deletion: allowed until match COMPLETED; blocked afterward (soft-delete API).
- Final scores: client submits `our_score`/`opponent_score` with `/complete`.
- On-pitch ordering: local-only per match (until dedicated lineups).
- Viewers: start with polling; SSE/WebSockets later.

## Information Architecture

- Single route: `/live/:matchId` (or `/live` â†’ nearest upcoming).
- Tabs (mobile):
  1) Controls â€“ timer, state/period controls, switcher, basic context.
  2) Events â€“ quick-add pad + reverse-chronological timeline.
  3) Overview â€“ location, competition, kickoff, period format.
- Anonymous/unauthorized users: read-only UI + polling, no controls.

## Header & Match Switcher

- Header: home logo+name | large score | away logo+name. Status chip underneath.
- Sub-row: venue â€¢ competition â€¢ kickoff datetime.
- Stoppage badge: show "+x" when elapsed > regulation minutes in a period (display-only).
- Switcher: left/right chevrons for upcoming list; tap center title opens bottom-sheet picker.

## State, Periods, and Timer

- Kick Off â†’ POST `/api/v1/matches/:id/start` (server creates first period); timer starts.
- Pause â†’ POST `/pause`; Resume â†’ POST `/resume`.
- End Period â†’ POST `/periods/end`; timer resets to 00:00.
- Start Next Period â†’ POST `/periods/start` (auto type by `period_format`, or `EXTRA_TIME`).
- After final regulation period (paused): show Extra Time and Complete.
- Extra Time: default 2 periods; option to select 1 if needed.
- Complete â†’ POST `/complete` with `{ our_score, opponent_score }`.

## Events â€“ Quick Add, Sentiment, Notes

- Team selector: sticky Home/Away pills.
- Quick-add grid (one-tap creates with sentiment 0): key_pass, save, interception, tackle, foul, free_kick, ball_out.
- Detail sheets:
  - Goal / Own goal: optional player picker; own_goals increment opponent UI score.
  - Penalty: represents taker; converted pen is a separate Goal (existing linking associates with Foul).
  - Assist: separate event; surface "Add assist?" CTA in goal snackbar.
- Sentiment:
  - Snackbar after add: [-] [0] [+] to set quickly; Undo included (5s).
  - Swipe on timeline chip: left=-1, right=+1 (bounded -3..+3).
  - Details sheet slider: -3..+3.
- Notes: editable in details sheet anytime (pre/post completion).
- Opponent events: allow `player_id = null`.

## Timeline

- Reverse chronological; grouped by period (e.g., 1st Half, 2nd Half, ET1).
- Each chip: icon, minute, team color accent, player (if any), sentiment badge (if != 0).
- Actions (authorized): delete (blocked after COMPLETED), edit notes, adjust sentiment.

## Offline & Sync

- IndexedDB queues per match (FIFO): state changes, period start/end, event create/delete.
- Optimistic apply; replace temp_ids on sync success.
- Conflict examples: resuming after completion â‡’ reject with toast, refresh server state.
- Timekeeping: store `period_local_start_at` + `pause_offset_ms`; compute `clock_ms` at event creation.

## Data Contracts (Client â†’ Server)

- Event create:
  - `match_id: uuid`
  - `period_number: integer`
  - `clock_ms: integer` (ms since period start)
  - `kind: event_kind`
  - `team_id: uuid`
  - `player_id: uuid | null`
  - `notes?: string`
  - `sentiment: integer` (-3..+3, default 0)
  - `temp_id: string`
- Event delete: `DELETE /api/v1/events/:id` (server soft-deletes).
- Match lifecycle:
  - `POST /start`, `POST /pause`, `POST /resume`, `POST /periods/start`, `POST /periods/end`,
  - `POST /complete` with `{ our_score, opponent_score }`.

## Components (Client)

- `LiveMatchPage` (route handler, tabs, data fetching)
- `MatchHeader` (logos, names, score, status, stoppage)
- `MatchSwitcher` (chevrons + bottom-sheet)
- `MatchTimer` (server-synced base, pause/resume, stoppage display)
- `ControlsBar` (Kick Off, Pause/Resume, End Period, Extra Time, Complete)
- `EventsQuickPad` (team pills, event grid)
- `EventPlayerPickerSheet` (roster, on-pitch toggle, sort)
- `SentimentSnackbar` ([-][0][+], Undo)
- `EventsTimeline` (grouped list, swipe sentiment/delete)
- `EventDetailSheet` (notes, slider -3..+3, delete)
